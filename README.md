# Classification of Pulsar Stars

This repository contains all relevant files for the first capstone project as part of Springboard's Data Science Bootcamp.

## Recruiters/Companies/Hiring Managers, please read:
The main culmination of the Data Science Bootcamp is the creation of the capstone projects, of which there are 2. To view the projects, go to the Capstone One or Capstone Two folders, with the main files of interest being located in the final project folder, which contain the following files:
* Capstone 1 ML code -> Jupyter Notebook containing machine learning code.
* Capstone 1 Final Report -> 10 page report for communicating overall findings of the project.
* Capstone 1 Presentation -> Slide deck for presentation.

In addition, the "Notebooks and Summaries" folder contains files that attributed to the final project, including:
* EDA and Statistical Inference code, via Jupyter Notebook.
* The relevant dataset.
* Report regarding the progress of the project.
* In-depth reporting regarding the machine learning process.

### Capstone 1
The first capstone project pertains to using statistical inference, machine learning techniques, and visualizations to sort through astronomical data. Determining if an individual observation is or is not a pulsar star (a type of neutron star) is the main goal of the project. For those intersted, the dataset can be found in the repository, as mentioned before, or at https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star.
